Android Project 2021 "Manage my Fridge" is an android app in which you log in new items in your fridge, and it reminds you of items about to expire. It also gives you ideas on what to do with the items in your fridge or lets you log in your own items to give you custom recipe ideas and also shows you zero waste hacks to reduce food waste.
